# Sysdig Assignment: Vulnerability Detection and Remediation

Welcome to the **Sysdig Assignment** repository! This repository contains all the necessary scripts and resources to help you set up and complete the lab described in `student-instructions.md`.

## Overview

In this lab, you will:

1. **Scan a container image for vulnerabilities** using Sysdig Secure.
2. **Deploy a vulnerable workload** on a Kubernetes cluster.
3. **Analyze runtime vulnerabilities** and learn how to remediate them effectively.

By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of container security best practices and how to leverage Sysdig Secure for real-world security use cases.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following:

1. **A Kubernetes cluster** (Minikube, Docker Desktop, or a managed cloud cluster will work).
2. **Sysdig Secure** account and credentials.
3. **Git** installed on your local machine.
4. **kubectl** CLI installed and configured to interact with your cluster.

## Lab Completion

Once you've analyzed the vulnerabilities and reviewed the remediation steps, your lab is complete. Be sure to reflect on the importance of regular image scanning and runtime monitoring in securing containerized applications.

## Additional Notes

- If you encounter issues, please check your Kubernetes setup and ensure Sysdig Secure is properly configured.
- Feel free to explore the additional scripts and resources in this repository for further experimentation.
